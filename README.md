How to Run Project
To begin, we must install libraries, and there are several methods for installing Python libraries on your machine. I will offer one approach for each operating system in this section.
First, check if libraries are already installed on your system:
#python
> >> import library_name
If you do not receive an error message, Libraries is already installed on your machine, and you should be able to begin working on the projects in this chapter right immediately. If you see an error notice, proceed to the section below for assistance in installing libraries on your operating system.
pip install (‘Libraries names’)
In this project it has been used some python libraries you can see below:
Numpy
Pandas
Tkinter
Matplotlib
